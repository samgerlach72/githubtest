                    <p class = 'intro'>Origins</br>Mr. MoneyBags did not start as a company. It started as a vision. That vision just happens to be me, sitting in a bathtub full of money on my private yacht. We don't care about you. We just want your money. This is the overarching principle of our entire brand. Our mission statement is one word. "Money." This is the glue that holds our company together. Without it, we would would be just as broke, and just as poor as the people who can't afford our products.</p>

                    <p class = 'intro'>Customer Service</br>Here at Mr. MoneyBags, the customer always comes last. That is why we offer all customers our signature $10 30-day shipping. We order our products from overseas, and don't even touch our own products. If you have an issue, or don't recieve your products, you'll have to contact our suppliers yourself. Our return policy is, "you get what you get and you dont throw a fit." It's true because it rhymes.</p>

                    <p class = 'intro'>Sustainability</br>At Mr. MoneyBags, we are committed to insustainability. That is why we use child labor from overseas. This is also why we only use fossil fuels for transportation of our materials. We are extremely passionate and experienced in insustainability. We recently hired some former oil executives to show us how we can improve. We pledge to be the greatest emitter of CO2 by the year 2035. It's going to be difficult, but that is how important this issue is to our brand.</p>
